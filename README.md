# pd-budgets

I believe it is important that the investments our city governments make align with our values. While the details of your city's budget are publically available, they are often not widely known. I am specifically concerned with the amount spent on maintaining and expanding police forces, and also understand the value in collecting this information for others' use.

To this end, this repo contains two deliverables:

1. A web application for visualizing police budgets, found at <a href="https://martenthompson.com">martenthompson.com</a>.

1. Budget data, both original and summarized, available here.

## Web Application
The R Shiny application currently provides a quick comparison of police spending across major cities. Users can view this in terms of either gross budget or per-capita cost. It is best viewed at <a href="https://martenthompson.com">martenthompson.com</a>.

This is very much under development, and your feedback is appreciated!

## Budget Data

Currently, I have budgets for the following locations/fiscal years:
